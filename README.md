Natural ventilation (NV) can effectively improve building energy efficiency by allowing fresh air indoors without energy use through heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and filter placement costs. This tools help designers to calculate natural ventilation rate with different window configurations. The use of this tool for NV-drivne design will be a great learning experience and also great opportunity to reduce unnecessary cooling load indoors.
